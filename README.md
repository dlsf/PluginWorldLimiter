# PluginWorldLimiter
Lightweight Spigot plugin which is able to block certain plugin commands in specific worlds.

## Usage
You can configure this plugin through a config.yml. Players with the permission `pwl.bypass` will be ignored.

```yaml
# The message which should be send when a command gets blocked
plugin-disabled-message: '&cSorry, but you can''t use this command here!'
# The name of the world for this configuration section
# You can add other ones in the same way
world:
  # The plugins whose commands should not be executable in this world.
  blocked-plugins:
  - WeirdPlugin1
  - WeirdPlugin2
  # All commands starting with these will be executed
  # even if they are blocked in the section above
